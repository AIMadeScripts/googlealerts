# googlealerts
Manager for Google Alerts

Simply run
1. ```git clone https://github.com/AIMadeScripts/googlealerts.git```
2. ```cd googlealerts```
3. ```python3 alerts.py```

In some circumstances, You will need to run the script twice. This is because the script will automatically install the packages it requires itself, but then can't call on them straight away or automatically restart the script.
